# Get Started

NativeScriptVueUse is based on [VueUse](https://vueuse.org/), it is a collection of utilities for [NativeScript-Vue3](https://github.com/nativescript-vue/nativescript-vue)

Most of the [VueUse](https://vueuse.org/) functions work by default in NativeScript-Vue, only utilities that depend on the dom or web elements are the functions that don't work in NativeScript-Vue. In addition, this package adds specific functions for Vue in Native.

## Installation



```bash
npm i @nativescript-use/vue
```
